# DCGAN_and_cVAE

Machine Learning Final Project report-
TITLE- A Comparative Study of two most popular models such as Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) and Variational Autoencoder(VAE) using MNIST dataset.

Description- Comparison between two models is done on the basis of architectural differences between the two sides of each network and a conducted experiment on MNIST handwritten data set. I further trained and tested our proposed models on MNIST dataset based on the numer of epochs/iterations 10, 100, 1000. In this comparative analysis, VAE performs better than GAN, since it produces best quality images as compared to GAN.
